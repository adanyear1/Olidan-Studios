                    Watch our first interview with Miguel Ortiz, a singer and songwriter from Austin, TX. During this interview he discusses his beginings in the music industry and how
                    he is a pioneer of the sierre&#241;o movement in Texas. Due to him being a songwriter we had to ask about how his compositions got into the hands of well-know regional Mexican
                    artists. We also get to learn about his experience with Rancho Humilde and how things did not work out as planned. Miguel also discusses his future plans of what he has coming up in the near future.

                    We had the opportunity to interview Hugo Cesar "El Zarco" a prolific artist within the Regional Mexican Music in the United States. We got to learn about how he got his start
                    performing at restaurants &amp; bars when he was a teenager. After a few years he contested in Tengo Talento, Mucho Talento and won first place, which opened a lot of doors for 
                    Hugo Cesar. During the interview we got to know more details of his move to the East Coast, where he has performed in venues in cities such as Philadelphia, Washington DC and Atlanta.
